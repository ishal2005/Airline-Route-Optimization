#  Airline Route Optimization System

Python **Tkinter GUI** application for **airline route optimization** using AI search algorithms:

- **BFS** (Breadth-First Search)  
- **DFS** (Depth-First Search)  
- **UCS** (Uniform Cost Search)  
- **A\*** (A-Star Search)  
- **CSP** (Constraint Satisfaction Problem with required/banned stops)


##  Features

-  **Visual Tkinter GUI** for route selection  
-  Multiple **AI Search Algorithms** for path finding  
-  **Constraint-based Search (CSP)**:
  - Include required stops  
  - Avoid banned stops  
  - Limit maximum stops  
-  Calculates **total path cost**  
-  Works on any small graph of airports & routes
